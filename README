A basic library that introduces object-oriented concepts and
features to ANSI C.

This project is intended as a learning exercise for me while
going through the "Object-Oriented Programming in ANSI-C"
pdf available at http://www.planetpdf.com/codecuts/pdfs/ooc.pdf

Using the Objective-C & GNUStep runtimes as references, many
features and concepts may appear similar but, at least for
the first version, I intend to use only the standard C compiler
and not Objective-C nor do I intend on building out the whole
resident runtime as it is done in Objective-C. I may devise
a way to generate class descriptions automatically but at
first, I will just create seperate class descriptions (AKA
MetaClasses; .r files), interfaces (.h files), and
implementations (.c files).
